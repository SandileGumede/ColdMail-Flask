# Fix for Supabase Client Error

## The Error
```
Failed to initialize Supabase client: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy'
```

This is a version compatibility issue with the Supabase Python client.

## Quick Fix

### 1. Update Your Requirements
The `requirements.txt` has been updated to use a compatible version:
```
supabase==2.8.0
```

### 2. Redeploy Your App
1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub
2. Render will automatically redeploy with the new requirements
3. The error should be resolved

### 3. Alternative: Use Local Authentication Only
If you still have issues, the app now has fallback mechanisms:
- If Supabase fails to initialize, it will use local authentication only
- Existing users can still log in
- New users can still sign up (without Supabase features)

## What I Fixed

1. **Updated Supabase version** to 2.8.0 (more stable)
2. **Added fallback mechanisms** for when Supabase fails
3. **Better error handling** that won't crash your app
4. **Alternative configuration** methods for different Supabase versions

## Testing

After deployment, check:
1. Your app starts without errors
2. Visit `/debug-login` to see if Supabase is working
3. Try logging in with existing credentials
4. Try signing up with a new account

## If Still Having Issues

The app will now work even if Supabase fails to initialize. You'll see messages like:
- "Supabase not available, using local authentication only"
- "Supabase features will be disabled"

This means your app is working, just without Supabase features (which is fine for basic functionality).
